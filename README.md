# PracticalMachineLearning Project

## Synopsis

This report is part of Coursera **Practical Machine Learning ** project. The goal of this project is to select **best Prediction Model ** to classify the excercise patters of any  participants as

- Class A : Exactly according to the specification
- Class B : Throwing the elbows to the front
- Class C : Lifting the dumbbell only halfway
- Class D : Lowering the dumbbell only halfway
- Class E : Throwing the hips to the front

with the raw data recorded from accelerometers/sensors on the belt, forearm, arm, and dumbell .Prediction can be done by training different model(Decision Tree,Random forest,GBM,SVM etc) with sample raw data collected from 6 participants and test it with the test data. Compare the accuracy of each model to select best model to **predict varaible Classe ** with data of any Participants.The data for this project come from this source: http://groupware.les.inf.puc-rio.br/har.
